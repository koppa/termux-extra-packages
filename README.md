# Termux Extra Packages

I'm finishing support of **Termux Extra Packages** repository. Prebuilt packages will be available over APT up to **01.10.2018**, after that I will shut down `https://termux.xeffyr.ml`.

X11 packages were moved to https://github.com/termux/x11-packages. All instructions can be found on repository [main](https://github.com/termux/x11-packages) page (see readme).
